# Citi Bike Trip Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to leverage data visualization tools such as _Tableau_ along with a public dataset to build simple and complex charts that tell a story with the data.

## Results

We were able to come up with 7 distinct visualizations that show different aspects of our data.

1. _Checkout Times_

- This chart shows that most of the bikes used in August of 2019 (~150K) were used for up to 5-6 mins

2. _Checkout Times by Gender_

- This chart shows that most of the bikes used in August of 2019 (~108K) were used for up to 5 mins by men while female customers used most of the bikes (~34K) for up to 6 mins

3. _Trips by Weekday per Hour_

- This chart shows in a very visual way a heatmap of the times in which most bikes were used which aligns with "Rush hour" in NYC which is between 8AM and 9AM and 5PM and 6PM during the weekdays with Thursday being the busiest day. We can also observe an even utilization during the day over the weekends, with Saturday being busier than Sunday.

4. _Trips by Weekday per Hour by Gender_

- This chart shows that most of riders are male during rush hour during weekdays

5. _Trips by Weekday per Hour by Gender and User Type_

- This chart shows a breakdown of users by user type demonstrating that Citibikes are used mostly by men who also turn out to be subscribers. We can observe the same pattern for our female customers and we can also observe that customers that are not subscribers tend to not provide gender information. This is something worth investigating why.

6. _Bike Utilization_

- This visualization shows all of our bikes and allows us to see which bikes have been utilized the most in minutes

7. _Bike Repairs_

- This visualization shows all of our bikes and allows us to see which bikes have been utilized the most and allows us to quickly visualize potential candidates for repairs due to their high utilization.

## Summary

Two additional visualizations for future analysis:

1. Popular Locations

- This might help Citibike understand which locations might need more additional bikes or where it's more critical to have working bikes due to high demand

2. Rush hour analysis by location

- This type of analysis would allow Citibike to schedule repair downtimes and analyze which locations require bikes before rush hour

For this Challenge, we created a Tableau Story which can be found in the following link: [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kermit6381/viz/Challenge_14_16296903216210/TripStory?publish=yes)
